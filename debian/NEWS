febootstrap (3.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * febootstrap 3.x is a complete rewrite. febootstrap 2.x could only
    build Fedora distributions. This version can build many varieties of
    Linux distros. 3.x only builds supermin appliances, it does not build
    chroots. 3.x does not build cross-distro, cross-release or
    cross-architecture systems.
