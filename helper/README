This directory contains the supermin-helper reimplementation in C.

This program builds the supermin appliance on the fly each time the
appliance runs (or in recent versions of libguestfs, the appliance is
cached as long as the host files don't change).

*NOTE*: This program is designed to be very short-lived, and so we
don't normally bother to free up any memory that we allocate.  That's
not completely true - we free up stuff if it's obvious and easy to
free up, and ignore the rest.
