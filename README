----------------------------------------------------------------------

febootstrap is a tool for building supermin appliances.  These are
tiny appliances [similar to virtual machines], usually around 100KB in
size, which get fully instantiated on-the-fly in a fraction of a
second when you need to boot one of them.

A complete description is in the febootstrap(8) man page.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR USERS OF FEBOOTSTRAP 2.x:
  febootstrap 3.x is a complete rewrite.  febootstrap 2.x could only
  build Fedora distributions.  This version can build many varieties
  of Linux distros.  3.x only builds supermin appliances, it does not
  build chroots.  3.x does not build cross-distro, cross-release or
  cross-architecture systems.  If you want febootstrap 2.x, please use
  the 'febootstrap-2.x' branch from the git repository.

Requirements
------------

  ocaml

  ocaml findlib ("ocamlfind" program)

  perldoc
    - This is just used to generate the manpage.

  bash

  gcc

  gawk

  libcom_err
  libext2fs
  /sbin/mke2fs
    - These are part of e2fsprogs.

For Fedora/RHEL:

  rpm
  yum
  yumdownloader

For Debian/Ubuntu:

  dpkg
  aptitude

Optional
--------

These are only needed if you plan to boot the supermin appliances you
are building:

  qemu >= 0.13
  kernel >= 2.6.36

Building and installing
-----------------------

  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
